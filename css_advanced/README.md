## ðŸš€ About the Project

This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering Curriculum**.  
It focuses on recreating a professional web page using **pure HTML and CSS**, based on a Figma design.

The goal is to learn:

- How to translate UI designs into code
- How to use **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for layouts
- How to structure reusable, scalable CSS
- How to create responsive and accessible web pages

All sections of the page were implemented:  
**Header**, **Hero banner**, **Quotes**, **Videos**, **Membership**, **FAQ**, and **Footer**.
